# Recipe Suggesting Voicebot
- The aim of this chatbot was discuss cooking and ingredients with the user and help them decide what recipe to make for their dinner party
- The bot users a dataframe of recipes that I have created from scraping various sites
- The final dataframe output includes cuisines that the users requests and any suggested ingredients. 
- For allegies the bot excludes specified ingredients 

#### Graphical outputs
- The bot creates three graphical outputs 
- 1) A word frequency plot - often in text analysis its useful to see the most frequently used words
- 2) A boxplot comparing the users response to a question and a fictitious survey. Compares where the user sits to the sample population
- 3) Sentimnet scores given to each question to allow the analyst to see how negative and positive the user responded to questions
